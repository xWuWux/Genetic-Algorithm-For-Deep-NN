Overview
This code is designed to evolve neural network architectures using a genetic algorithm. The goal is to find the best architecture for classifying the Iris dataset, which is a popular dataset for machine learning.

Dependencies
TensorFlow: Used for building and training the neural network.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
random: Used for generating random numbers.
Constants
MIN_LAYER, MAX_LAYER: Define the minimum and maximum number of layers the neural network can have.
MAX_NEURONS: The maximum number of neurons in each layer.
POPULATION: The number of individuals in the population. It should be divisible by 4.
GENERATIONS: The number of iterations the algorithm will go through.
TARGET_SCORE: The desired accuracy score. If achieved, the algorithm stops.
MUTATION_CHANCE: The probability of mutation for each individual in each generation.
NO_EVOLVE_GENS: The number of generations without improvement in score after which the algorithm will stop.
CSV_COLUMN_NAMES, SPECIES: Constants related to the Iris dataset.
Functions
generate_individual(): Generates a random individual, which represents a neural network architecture.

initialize(): Initializes the population with random individuals.

cost(ind): Evaluates the performance of an individual by training a neural network with the architecture represented by the individual and returning its accuracy.

sort(pop_with_cost): Sorts the population based on their scores.

roulette(pop_with_cost): Implements roulette wheel selection to select individuals based on their fitness.

cross_parents(parent1, parent2, cross_point): Performs crossover between two parents to produce a child.

crossover(pop): Applies crossover to the population.

calculate_missing_cost(pop): Calculates the scores for individuals that don't have them.

mutate(pop): Applies mutation to the population.

gather_text(pop, g, best, text): Gathers text for logging purposes.

final_text(stop, text): Prints the final results and reasons for stopping.

input_fn(features, labels, training=True, batch_size=256): A utility function for TensorFlow to read the dataset.

DNN(population_for_DNN): Builds and trains a deep neural network based on the architecture represented by an individual. Returns the accuracy of the model.

Main Execution
The main execution (if __name__ == "__main__" ...) does the following:

Downloads the Iris dataset and loads it into pandas dataframes.
Initializes the population.
Trains a neural network for each individual in the population and assigns a score.
Iterates through generations, applying selection, crossover, and mutation.
Checks for stopping conditions: if the target score is achieved, if the population stops evolving, or if the maximum number of generations is reached.
Prints the final results.
Notes
The code uses TensorFlow's Estimator API to build and train the neural network.
The genetic algorithm uses roulette wheel selection, one-point crossover, and mutation to evolve the population.
The architecture of the neural network is represented as a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of neurons in a layer.
